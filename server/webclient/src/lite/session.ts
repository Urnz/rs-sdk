// One bot session: bootstrap the cache, log in, and pump packets on a timer.
//
// The loop is deliberately dumb compared to GameShell.run(): there is no redraw
// to pace against, so we just drain the socket every LOOP_MS. The 274 server
// ticks at 300-600ms, so 20ms polling is far below the noise floor while costing
// almost nothing.
//
// Death policy. A session that ends never resumes itself - reconnecting is the
// caller's call, because it owns whatever state was mid-flight. What this file
// guarantees is that an ending is always *noticed*: every exit resolves `stopped`
// (and calls `onEnd`) with a reason, including the two that used to be silent -
// a remote hang-up, which leaves `available` at 0 forever, and a socket that goes
// quiet without closing. A single bad packet is not an ending; see handlePacket.
