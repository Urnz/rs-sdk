# RS-SDK

Research-oriented starter kit for runescape-style bots, including a typescript sdk, agent documentation and bindings, and a server emulator. Works out of the box - tell it what to automate!

Build and operate bots within a complex economic role-playing MMO. You can automate the game, level an account to all 99s, and experiment with agentic development techniques within a safe, bot-only setting.

The goals of this project are to provide a rich testing environment for goal-directed program synthesis techniques (Ralph loops, etc), and to facilitate research into collaboration and competition between agents.

![Task Length Distribution](docs/media/task_length.svg)

There is currently a [leaderboard](https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/hiscores) for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level per lowest account playtime.

See the [benchmark comparing models](https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-bench) for evaluation results across different LLMs.

> [!NOTE]
> RS-SDK is a fork of the LostCity engine/client, an amazing project without which rs-sdk would not be possible.

## Getting Started:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-sdk.git
```

Out of the box, you can connect to the provided demo server, choose a name that is not already taken!

With claude code:
```sh
bun install
claude "start a new bot with name: {username}"
```
Manually:
```sh
bun install
bun bots/create-bot.ts {username}
bun bots/{username}/script.ts 
```

## Agent API and knowledge

The exact generated API surface is documented in
[`sdk/API.md`](sdk/API.md). High-level `bot.*` methods attempt to observe
method-specific game effects; low-level `sdk.send*` methods confirm
browser-client dispatch and do not prove the server applied the effect.

MCP `execute_code` snippets receive `bot` and `sdk` globals. Standalone files
under `bots/<name>/` instead use `runScript(async ({ bot, sdk }) => { ... })`;
see [`learnings/README.md`](learnings/README.md) for copyable examples.
The current executor evaluates JavaScript-compatible async bodies directly, so
use the TypeScript API reference for type information but omit type-only syntax
from an `execute_code` body.

Chat is shown by default. Note that seeing other players' chat exposes the bot to scamming and prompt-injection attempts; opt out with `SHOW_CHAT=false` in the bot.env file (or `bun bots/create-bot.ts <name> --no-chat`).

Warning: The demo server is offered as a convenience, and we do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Hold your accounts lightly, and consider hosting your own server instance. Please do not manually play on the demo server. 




## Gameplay Modifications

This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:

- **Faster leveling** - The XP curve is accelerated and less steep.
- **Infinite run energy** - Players never run out of energy 
- **No random events** - Anti-botting random events are disabled 


## Architecture:

rs-sdk runs against an enhanced web-based client (`botclient`) which connects to the LostCity 2004scape server emulator.

There is a gateway server which accepts connections from botclient and SDK instances, and forwards messages between them based on username.
Once connected to the gateway, the botclient relays game state to the SDK and
dispatches low-level actions such as `sendWalk(x, z)` from the SDK. Dispatch
success is not confirmation that the game server applied the intended effect.

This means that the SDK can't talk directly to the game server, but must go through the botclient. It will attempt to launch the botclient on startup if one is not already running. 

You don't need to run the gateway/botclient in order to run automations against the demo server, but you may choose to if you are fixing bugs or adding features to the rs-sdk project


## Running the server locally

Running the server locally has many advantages, primary being the ability to set a high tickrate. 

You can set tickrate in `server/engine/.env` via the `NODE_TICKRATE` variable (default is 400ms, try 200ms or 30ms for faster gameplay, especially useful for headless testing). You can also change it at runtime with the in-game `::speed <ms>` command (minimum 20ms, doesn't persist across restarts).

The chat profanity filter can be disabled with `NODE_PROFANITY_FILTER=false` (default on). The server censors chat before broadcasting and injects the setting into the browser client; headless lite runners have no config channel from the server, so also set `PROFANITY_FILTER=false` in the bot's `bot.env` (or process env) to stop their local re-censoring.

You want all three of these running: 

```sh
# Game engine
cd server/engine && bun run start
```
```sh
# Web client bundler
cd server/webclient && bun run watch
```
```sh
# Gateway (bridges SDK <-> bot client)
cd server/gateway && bun run gateway
```

The gateway listens on `ws://localhost:7780` by default (configurable via `AGENT_PORT` env var).

## Development checks

Install the root and webclient dependencies, then run the same checks as CI:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
(cd server/webclient && bun install --frozen-lockfile)
bun run check
```

`bun run docs:api` regenerates the API reference. CI fails when that document
does not match the public TypeScript class surface.


### 2. Connect a bot to the local gateway

The `SERVER` variable in `bot.env` controls where the bot connects. To use your local gateway, **leave `SERVER` blank**:

```bots/<botname>/bot.env
BOT_USERNAME=mybot
PASSWORD=test
SERVER=
SHOW_CHAT=true
```

When `SERVER` is empty, all connection paths (scripts, CLI) default to `ws://localhost:7780`.

When `SERVER` is set to a hostname (e.g. `rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev`), they connect to `wss://{SERVER}/gateway` instead.

This is a free, open-source, community-run project.

The goal is strictly education and scientific research.

LostCity Server was written from scratch after many hours of research and peer review. Everything you see is completely and transparently open source.

You cannot play Old School RuneScape here, buy RuneScape gold, or access any of the official game's services! Bots developed here will not work on the official game servers.

### Grand Exchange

The server includes a player-funded Grand Exchange at Varrock west bank, with a
5% seller tax and a public price dashboard at `/market`. To run without GE, set
`GE_ENABLED=false` in the engine environment and restart the server (no content
rebuild needed). It defaults to `true`. Disabling GE restores the ordinary bank
table and hides the teller and market link,
and the SDK reports `ge_unavailable` when asked to use GE. See the
[market API and player guide](sdk/MARKET.md) and
[maintenance notes](docs/grand-exchange.md).
